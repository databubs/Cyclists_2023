# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
This project analyzes the bike-share data from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal of the analysis is to better understand how Cyclistic's customers are using the bikes and identify trends and patterns in their behavior.

# Data
The data used for this analysis was provided by Cyclistic and consists of trip records from Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. The data was preprocessed to remove any missing values and ensure consistency in formatting. Filling blank values to 0. Removed duplicates, and formatting 

# Analysis
The analysis was conducted in R and includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The following questions were addressed in the analysis:
How many riders are there?

How many are casuals compared to annual riders

# Who are Cyclistic's main users?
How do the customers' behavior differ between casual and members?

How do the usage patterns differ by time of day, day of the week, and month?

What are the most popular routes and destinations for Cyclistic's customers?

# Results
The analysis revealed several insights about Cyclistic's customers:

The majority of customers are members rather than casual riders.
Members tend to use the bikes more frequently and for shorter periods of time than casual riders.
Bike usage varies by time of day, with peak usage in the morning and evening rush hours.
Bike usage also varies by day of the week, with higher usage on weekdays than on weekends.
The most popular routes and destinations are located in the city center and near tourist attractions.
Conclusion
The results of the analysis provide valuable insights for Cyclistic's business strategy. For example, they can use the information about their main users to target marketing efforts more effectively, or adjust pricing and incentives to encourage more casual riders to become members. The insights about usage patterns can also inform decisions about bike placement and maintenance.
